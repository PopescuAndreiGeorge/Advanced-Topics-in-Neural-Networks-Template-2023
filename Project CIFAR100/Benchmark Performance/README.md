## Benchmark Performance

* I built an architecture based on several convolutional neural networks within which I can use a model to divide the data into some coarse classes, then using a model for each of these classes to predict the specific label of the input. For a thorough testing, we used different types of convolutional networks in order to see the effectiveness of different combinations between them.
